In this lab, I explored how Wazuh detects Windows persistence techniques using Sysmon logs and custom rules. While Sysmon recorded every event perfectly, I learned that Wazuh doesn‚Äôt automatically alert unless a rule tells it to. Here‚Äôs how I found, fixed, and confirmed a missing detection.

I started by creating a scheduled task that launches calc.exe every few minutes to simulate persistence.

Confirmed they were seen by Sysmon

By searching "sysmon" I was able to narrow down the logs and then I narrowed it further between 10:30PM & 11PM and was able to find the event below.

But in a real environment manually going through alerts is a nightmare so I used this query to find Sysmon alerts with Event ID 1 (Process creation):
	data.win.system.providerName:"Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon" AND data.win.system.eventID:1

Then I quickly found this entry

Expanding it shows more details like the exact cmd line

side note, something I learned was that when setting creds via net user (which I did to set up RDP on the target machine) will show the password in cleartext in the sysmon event logs

It does not show up in built in WindowsEventLogs unless you enable Advanced auditing by doing the following:

1. `Win + R` ‚Üí `secpol.msc`
2. Advanced Audit Policy Configuration ‚Üí **System Audit Policies** ‚Üí **Detailed Tracking**
3. Double-click **Audit Process Creation** ‚Üí check **Success** (and **Failure** if you want) ‚Üí **OK**.

I did not do the above, it was not in the scope of this particular post but we can circle back to it at a later date if needed.

Moving on...
## Detecting the schtasks task creation command

Went through the ringer a bit on this one.

So first I created the schtask
```cmd
schtasks /create /sc minute /mo 50 /tn "TestTask" /tr "calc.exe"
```

Can confirm that the task was created and ID'd by Sysmon logs Event ID 1

But it was not showing up in Wazuh AT ALL... I went through a ton of research to find out why but ... the TLDR version of it is below
### üß© Gotcha Moment ‚Äî When Sysmon Events Go Missing in Wazuh

This one had me chasing ghosts. I could see the Sysmon event for `schtasks.exe` in Windows Event Viewer, but it never showed up in Wazuh. At first, I suspected a bad query ‚Äî but the real issue was deeper: **Wazuh doesn‚Äôt alert on events unless a rule explicitly tells it to.**

By default, Wazuh receives the raw Sysmon data but ignores anything without a matching rule. Since there was no rule for `schtasks.exe` process creation (Event ID 1), those events never made it into the Wazuh alerts index.

The fix was to add a **custom rule** inside the Wazuh Manager container at: 
`/var/ossec/etc/rules/local_rules.xml`

```xml
<group name="windows,sysmon,persistence,">
  <rule id="100502" level="10">
    <description>Sysmon ProcessCreate: schtasks.exe observed</description>
    <if_group>sysmon_event1</if_group>
    <match>\\schtasks.exe</match>
  </rule>
</group>
```

After saving the file and restarting Wazuh with:
```bash
sudo docker exec -it single-node-wazuh.manager-1 /var/ossec/bin/wazuh-control restart
```

Then I ran the scheduled task creation command again

```cmd
schtasks /create /sc minute /mo 50 /tn "TestTask" /tr "calc.exe"
```

Then...

BOOM!

{{< image src="success1.png" alt="success1" >}}

I can now see it in Wazuh.

## üß© Wrapping It Up

This lab was a good reminder that **detection isn‚Äôt just about data collection ‚Äî it‚Äôs about interpretation.** Sysmon saw the event immediately, but Wazuh didn‚Äôt raise its hand until I told it what to look for. Once that rule was in place, everything clicked.

The takeaway is simple but critical:

> Wazuh won‚Äôt alert on what it doesn‚Äôt understand ‚Äî if you want visibility, you have to teach it what matters. I guess that's why people LOVE tuning SIEMs and alert tools.

So if you‚Äôre building detections, don‚Äôt stop at collecting logs. Always verify that your rules actually _fire_ the way you expect. Even the best telemetry means nothing without context.

‚ÄúWith custom rules firing properly, Wazuh is now ready for deeper endpoint detection tests ‚Äî next, I‚Äôll simulate privilege escalation and lateral movement to see how Wazuh responds.‚Äù

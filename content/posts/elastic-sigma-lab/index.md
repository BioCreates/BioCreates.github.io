## Overview

This lab was my first attempt at detection engineering with **Elastic + Sigma**.  
I set up a temporary Elastic/Kibana stack in Docker, connected a Windows VM via Elastic Agent, simulated persistence with `schtasks`, and hunted it with a converted Sigma rule.

Along the way, I hit a bunch of errors that forced me to dig deeper ‚Äî exactly the kind of troubleshooting I want to document here.

---

## Step 1 ‚Äì Elastic in Docker

I started by installing Docker and creating a `docker-compose.yml` to bring up **Elasticsearch** and **Kibana**:

```yaml
services:
  elasticsearch:
    image: docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.12.2
    container_name: es01
    environment:
      - node.name=es01
      - discovery.type=single-node
      - xpack.security.enabled=true
      - ELASTIC_PASSWORD=${ELASTIC_PASSWORD}
      - xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled=false
      - xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled=false
      - ES_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms1g -Xmx1g
    ports:
      - "9200:9200"
    volumes:
      - esdata:/usr/share/elasticsearch/data

  kibana:
    image: docker.elastic.co/kibana/kibana:8.12.2
    container_name: kib01
    environment:
      - ELASTICSEARCH_HOSTS=http://elasticsearch:9200
      - ELASTICSEARCH_USERNAME=kibana_system
      - ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD=KibanaPass123!
      - NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=512
    ports:
      - "5601:5601"
    depends_on:
      - elasticsearch
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  esdata:
```
And an .env file with the superuser password:

```.env
ELASTIC_PASSWORD=ChangeMe123!
```

### üí° Gotcha ‚Äì Wrong account for Kibana
At first I tried logging into Kibana with the elastic superuser, but Kibana requires its own service account (kibana_system).
I had to reset its password with:
```Powershell
Invoke-RestMethod `
  -Method POST `
  -Uri "http://localhost:9200/_security/user/kibana_system/_password" `
  -Headers @{ "Content-Type" = "application/json" } `
  -Body '{ "password": "KibanaPass123!" }' `
  -Credential (New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential("elastic", (ConvertTo-SecureString "ChangeMe123!" -AsPlainText -Force)))
```
## Step 2 ‚Äì Installing the Windows Agent

The Elastic portal gave me a one-liner installer, but it failed. Instead I:

    Manually downloaded the ZIP from Elastic‚Äôs site.

    Extracted it to C:\Elastic\elastic-agent-8.12.2-windows-x86_64\.

    Noticed that running the agent actually created another directory:
    C:\Program Files\Elastic\Agent\ with its own elastic-agent.yml.

That‚Äôs the config Elastic actually uses ‚Äî not the one in the extracted folder.

I edited it to point to my host instead of localhost:
```yml
outputs:
  default:
    type: elasticsearch
    hosts:
      - 'http://192.168.1.105:9200'
    username: 'elastic'
    password: 'ChangeMe123!'
    preset: balanced
```
Then restarted the agent:
```Powershell
Restart-Service -Name "Elastic Agent"
```
### üí° Gotcha ‚Äì Wrong config file
Editing the extracted .yml did nothing. The real config lives in
C:\Program Files\Elastic\Agent\elastic-agent.yml.
Step 3 ‚Äì Simulating Persistence

On the VM, I created a scheduled task to dump whoami every minute:
```cmd
schtasks /create /sc minute /mo 1 /tn "UpdaterSvc" /tr "cmd.exe /c whoami > C:\Windows\Temp\whoami.txt" /ru SYSTEM /f
```
Could also be ran with PowerShell:
```Powershell
$A = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute "cmd.exe" -Argument "/c whoami > C:\Windows\Temp\whoami_ps.txt"
$T = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -Once -At (Get-Date).AddMinutes(1)
Register-ScheduledTask -TaskName "UpdaterSvcPS" -Action $A -Trigger $T -User "SYSTEM" -RunLevel Highest
```
Sysmon (event ID 1) captured it, and Elastic showed both the event and the whoami.txt file being written.

## Step 4 ‚Äì Writing & Converting a Sigma Rule

I wrote my Sigma rule: artifacts/sigma/scheduled_task_creation_schtasks.yml
```yml
title: Scheduled Task Creation via Schtasks
id: 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000
status: experimental
description: Detects creation of scheduled tasks via schtasks.exe
author: RoninSec
date: 2025/08/24
logsource:
  product: windows
  service: sysmon
detection:
  selection:
    EventID: 1
    Image|endswith: '\schtasks.exe'
  condition: selection
fields:
  - CommandLine
level: medium
```
### Conversion with Sigma CLI

Installed Sigma CLI and plugins:
```cmd
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install sigma-cli
sigma plugin install elasticsearch
sigma plugin install sysmon
```
Converted rule to Lucene:
```cmd
sigma convert -t lucene -p ecs_windows .\artifacts\sigma\scheduled_task_creation_schtasks.yml -o .\artifacts\scheduled_task_creation_schtasks_lucene.txt
```
### üí° Gotchas ‚Äì Conversion errors

    Missing UUID ‚Üí Sigma requires a proper UUID for id. Fixed by adding one.

    YAML formatting error ‚Üí My first draft had bad indentation. Fixed spacing.

    Lucene vs KQL ‚Üí Elastic Discover defaults to KQL. Had to switch search language to Lucene.

{{< image src="elasticsyntaxerror.png" alt="Lucene Syntax Error" caption="Error I got before switching language in Elastic" >}}


## Step 5 ‚Äì Hunting in Elastic

The final working Lucene query:
```
winlog.channel:"Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational" AND event.code:1 AND process.executable:*\\schtasks.exe
```
‚úÖ This returned the scheduled task execution events as expected.

### Wrap-Up

    Docker ran Elastic + Kibana fine on my lab box.

    Standalone agent required editing the right .yml in Program Files.

    Sysmon captured the persistence technique.

    Sigma rule + CLI let me hunt it in Elastic (after fixing UUID, YAML, and query language).

## Gotchas Appendix üìñ

Quick reference of issues I ran into:

    Kibana login failed ‚Üí Tried using elastic superuser; Kibana requires kibana_system.

    Agent not connecting ‚Üí Edited the wrong .yml. The real one is in Program Files.

    Agent pointing to localhost ‚Üí Default config uses http://localhost:9200; needed 192.168.1.105.

    Sigma UUID missing ‚Üí Every Sigma rule needs a UUID.

    YAML formatting error ‚Üí Misaligned indentation broke parsing.

    Lucene vs KQL ‚Üí Elastic defaults to KQL. Switched to Lucene to run converted queries.

## Useful Docker Commands üêã

Some Docker commands I used throughout:
```cmd
docker ps               # list running containers
docker compose up -d    # start services in background
docker compose down     # stop services
docker logs es01        # check logs for Elasticsearch
docker logs kib01       # check logs for Kibana
docker exec -it es01 sh # open a shell inside the container
```
### What‚Äôs Next

    Learn Elastic/Kibana query building in more depth.

    Deploy Wazuh permanently in my environment.

    Write more Sigma rules for persistence techniques.

    Later: simulate a Wi-Fi attack on my own network and test if alerts catch it.

‚ö° Takeaway: This lab wasn‚Äôt clean copy-paste work ‚Äî I ran into real-world gotchas at almost every step.
Fixing them forced me to learn how Elastic, its accounts, the Agent configs, and Sigma all actually fit together.
